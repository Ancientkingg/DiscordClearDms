# DiscordClearDms
 I found this script ages ago and i cant find it anymore so im posting it here, it can clear your discord dms, and clear all the messages in a channel that you have sent. The commands are: cleardms - it does what it says, send it anywhere and it will fetch your dms and delete them, all of them. cl - fetches the messages you sent in a channel and deletes them.
